Make sure you do the following steps in VScode, but NOT on a virtual machine, the program will not pop up on a virtual machine, as it will not recognize your screen as one that is useable and so it will give an error.

Use the command: git clone https://github.com/sdabizljevic/speedfight.git

Use the command: cargo run 

The game should open from there!
